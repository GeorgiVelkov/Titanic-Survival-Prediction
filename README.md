Familiarising myself with Kaggle competitions, a simple solution for a simple Binary CLassification problem. The task is use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

The notebook includes data cleaning, EDA, fitting a Logistic Regression model and visualising the predictions.
